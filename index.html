          Originally starting out under the moniker DJ3, circa 1996 in the
          Dallas/Fort Worth area, Halon was a resident member of Denton Texas'
          Record Resource crew. Halon moved to San Francisco in the fall of '99,
          becoming a resident of the underground warehouse scene and at various
          clubs and bars. While in San Francisco, Halon started running weekly
          events with For The Music and then helped found the music side of
          <a href="https://www.false-profit.com/">False Profit</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Halon ran the sound system for False Profit at 43 Norfolk and helped
          put on many late nights at the warehouse. He has also joined forces
          with different crews and venues, including Dub Beautiful, Ambient
          Airlines, Space Cowboys, B-Family, Eklektic, Future Breaks,
          Tenderloft, Tags Trance Trip, GrooveTech Radio, Anon Salon, Trust,
          Wish, Mighty SF, DNA Lounge, 1015 Folsom, and many more.
        </p>

        <p>
          In 2004, Halon helped co-found
          <a href="http://cedub.com/">Cedub Studios</a> with owner Chris Walcott
          and moved away from DJing to focus on production and engineering for
          local Bay Area artists. Halon helped create and launch the music &
          production company Fake Science, first as a podcast, then expanded the
          company to online digital music distribution and A&R. During this
          time, he produced Drum and Bass tracks under the name Cell Culture
          with his co-founder Chris Walcott. He also began producing Dubstep
          tracks as The Clockmakers with DJ Yap, under the moniker DJ Bespoke.
        </p>

        <p>
          In 2009, Halon took a break from music and production and moved to San
          Diego. Halon returned to DJing in the fall of 2018 and began producing
          music again in the summer of 2019. Halon released his debut EP on Hush
          Recordz at the end of 2019 after nearly a decade long hiatus.
