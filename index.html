          weekly events with For The Music and then helped found the music side
          of
          <a href="https://www.false-profit.com/">False Profit</a>. James ran
          the sound system for False Profit at 43 Norfolk and helped put on many
          amazing nights at the warehouse. He has also joined forces with many
          different crews and venues, including Dub Beautiful, Ambient Airlines,
          Space Cowboys, B-Family, Eklektic, Future Breaks, Tenderloft, Tags

          <a href="http://cedub.com/">Cedub Studios</a> with owner Chris
          Walcott. During this time James moved away from djing to focus on
          production and engineering for local artists. James helped create and
          launch Fake Science LLC. first, as a podcast, then expanded the
          company to online digital music distribution and A&R. He produced
          tracks under the Cell Culture act with his co-founder Chris Walcott.

          In 2009, James moved from the Bay and headed to his now home, San
          Diego. After a much too long hiatus, James is back on the 1s and 2s,
          bringing his love for djing and playing on freaking massive sound
          systems.
